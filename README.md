## Bound Picture Box/Image Control, SQL/ACCESS DB, ADO and VB


</div>

### Description

With SQL Server, to save a value to a field with an IMAGE data type, a programmer must provide the proper means to save the data so that the data can be properly interpreted by a bound picture box or an image control. Simply binding the image field to a picture box and populating your picture box with a LoadPicture command will not save the image to the database. Here, I will share with you how I tackle this problem so that I can make use of the bound capabilities of an image or picture box. I've tried this way both in SQL Server 2000 and MS Access database, and it all works. With this program, a MS ACCESS database is used, but don't worry, with SQL Servers, you will just have to change the connection string definition in order to access the database and off you go.... Enjoy.
